# About Me
______________________________________________________________________________________

Hi, my name is Johanna Kuhn and I am at Liberty Hill High School. I was born and raised in Texas. My favorite hobby is sewing and cooking. I took the class to explore my recent interest in engineering. I've always been a creative person and would like to find a career that will put that skill to use and create robots and machines that will improve people's lives.

# My Final Project

For my final project, I would like to create a robot that will be helpful to the people in my life. When I started to think about people in my life who could use some extra help I thought about my grandma. My grandma has been staying at my house for a while now and over time I noticed that she would always call me to her to pick up something she dropped up for her due to her dwindling mobility. I get worried when I'm not home whether she'll be alright on her own. I don't want her to fall or hurt herself picking something up. My robot will be able to pick up things that have been dropped and will be able to bring them to a height that doesn't require you to bend downwards. 

And here is a some designs I have for it so far.
