# About Me and My Final Project

Hi, My name is Johanna Kuhn. I am highschool student attending Harvard Secondary School and passionate about designing robots and machines.

Here is an image:

My idea for my final project is a robot that picks objects up from the floor so people don't need to bend down to get it. I got this idea because my Grandma has been staying with me for a while now, and I noticed that she really struggled moving around and needed help everytime something fell on the floor.
This robot would pick up the fallen object and move it to a height that is easier to reach. With this I think I would feel more at ease of my Grandma staying home alone while I'm at school.

And here is a [link](../index.html).
