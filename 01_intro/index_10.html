## Final project:


For my final project, I would like to create a robot that will be helpful to the people in my life. When I started to think about people in my life who could use some extra help I thought about my grandma. My grandma has been staying at my house for a while now and over time I noticed that she would always call me to her to pick up something she dropped up for her due to her. I get worried when I'm not home whether she'll be alright on her own. I don't want her to fall or hurt herself picking something up. My robot will be able to pick up things that have been dropped and will be able to bring them to a height that doesn't require you to bend downwards. 
Here is a design I have for it so far.

### Conveyor Belt

## Fusion360 drawing:
I created the pieces of the conveyor belt on fusion360.

<img src="Sides of conveyor belt.jpg" width="400" > <img align= "right" img src="tube supports.jpg" width="400" >

Then I used the laser cutter to cut the peices out of wood. After I cut the pieces out I hand-sawed multiple tubes and wooden rods in order to make the axels of the tubes and wheels. 
I then started to assemble the conveyor belt using the wood glue.

## Connect to motor:

I programmed the motor to turn on and off at the flip of a switch. I also had to connect it to a battery. In order to make it move I need to make a base on the side of the conveyor belt to keep the circuit in place while in motion.

## Here is the code:

## Adding the belt:

After the base of the conveyor belt was put together I was able to wrap a rubber sheet around the tubes. With the supports on the sides of the conveyor, I was able to tighten the rubber sheet.


Here is how is the finished conveyor belt:

### Wheels

## Fusion360 drawing:

I made 4 wheels measuring 76.20 mm in diameter with a small hole of 9.80 mm in diameter in its center in fusion360 and then used the laser cutter to cut them out.

## Assembly:

I used the wooden rod as the axel of my wheels and used wood glue to glue them together. Now that that's dried I can move on to working on the base of the machine and motors.

### Base Sketch:

<center><img src="final base sketch.jpg" width="500" ></center>

This is simply an open lidded box. I used just 4 pieces of wood in total. 

## Here is the fusion360 drawing:

## Here are the pieces assembled.
