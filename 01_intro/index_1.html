## 1: Final Project


For my final project, I would like to create a robot that will be helpful to the people in my life. When I started to think about people in my life who could use some extra help I thought about my grandma. My grandma has been staying at my house for a while now and over time I noticed that she would always call me to her to pick up something she dropped up for her due to her. I get worried when I'm not home whether she'll be alright on her own. I don't want her to fall or hurt herself picking something up. My robot will be able to pick up things that have been dropped and will be able to bring them to a height that doesn't require you to bend downwards. 
Here is a design I have for it so far.

### Conveyor Belt and Base
I first created the base and the conveyor belt. The box has a width of 279.4 mm, a length of 254.0 mm, and a hieght of 152.4 mm. The conveyor belt has a diameter of 88.9 mm and is 375.00 mm long.

After I cut the pieces out I handsaw a tube with a diameter of 76.20 mm to make two tubes with a hieght of 254 mm.
