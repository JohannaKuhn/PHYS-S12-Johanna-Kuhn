## 6: Electronic Input Devices

### phototransistor

For the first part of this assignment I programmed a phototransistor. 

# Here is what it looks like:

# A graph of my findings with it:
I found that the numbers it recieves vary depending on how much light the phototransistor detects. With this being said I recorded how much light it detected with varying amounts of light. I found that when covered with your hands it detects an average of 97.5 of light, but when I increased the amount of light on it it reached to a maximum of 392. I found that I could control this number by adding and subtracting the amount of light on the phototransistor.

### Capacitive Sensor

I made a rotating capacitive sensor because I wanted to see how the data would change as one side rotates. I included a Servo motor to make one side move 180 degrees and back.

First I started by making two circles in Fusion360. their diameter is 110 mm and I hand cut triangles off the edges so that the alligator clips could attach to the metal. After that I hot glues the metal to the circles and ho glued them opposite of each other on a box. I connected the Servo motor to one side and programmed it to spin 180 degrees. I measured the capacity while it spun.

# Here is the Arduino code for the phototransister:

  /*
  AnalogReadSerial

  Reads an analog input on pin 0, prints the result to the Serial Monitor.
  Graphical representation is available using Serial Plotter (Tools > Serial Plotter menu).
  Attach the center pin of a potentiometer to pin A0, and the outside pins to +5V and ground.

  This example code is in the public domain.

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // read the input on analog pin 0:
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  // print out the value you read:
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(1);  // delay in between reads for stability
}
