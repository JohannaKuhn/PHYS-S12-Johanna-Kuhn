# phototransistor

For the first part of this assignment I programmed a phototransistor. 

# The schematic:

# Here is what it looks like:

# A graph of my findings with it:

I found that the numbers it recieves vary depending on how much light the phototransistor detects. With this being said I recorded how much light it detected with varying amounts of light. I found that when covered with your hands it detects an average of 97.5 of light, but when I increased the amount of light on it it reached to a maximum of 392. I found that I could control this number by adding and subtracting the amount of light on the phototransistor.

# Capacitive Sensor

I made a rotating capacitive sensor because I wanted to see how the data would change as one side rotates. I included a Servo motor to make one side move 180 degrees and back, so that I could calculate the distance between the two more accurately.

First I started by making two circles in Fusion360. Their diameter is 110 mm and I hand cut triangles off the edges so that the alligator clips could attach to the metal. After that I hot glues the metal to the circles and ho glued them opposite of each other on a box. I connected the Servo motor to one side and programmed it to spin 180 degrees. I measured the capacity while it spun.

The farther the two metals were apart the less capacity was sensed.

# Here is the Arduino codes for both:
