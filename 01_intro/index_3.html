## 3: Kinetic Scultpure

Our assignment was to build a kinetic sculpture using circuitry. I came up with a boat that would rock back and forth using wire and a motor, so I drew out my design first.

After designing it I redrew it in Fusion360. 

## For the boat shape: 
I used a diameter of 152.40 mm and then split it in half to make two semi-circles. I created a hole with a diameter of 1.00 mm centered 38.1 mm from the bottom of the shape and 38.1 mm from the side of the shape. 
For the underside of the boat shape I halfed the circumferense of the circles to make the length of the rectangle shape and the width would be 76.20 mm. For the top of the boat shape I made another rectangle with the measurements of 76.20 mm by 152.40 mm with a hole with a diameter of 1.00 mm centered in the center of the shape.
