## 1: Final Project


For my final project, I would like to create a robot that will be helpful to the people in my life. When I started to think about people in my life who could use some extra help I thought about my grandma. My grandma has been staying at my house for a while now and over time I noticed that she would always call me to her to pick up something she dropped up for her due to her. I get worried when I'm not home whether she'll be alright on her own. I don't want her to fall or hurt herself picking something up. My robot will be able to pick up things that have been dropped and will be able to bring them to a height that doesn't require you to bend downwards. 
Here is a design I have for it so far.

### Conveyor Belt
## Things you need:

I first created the pieces of the conveyor belt.

After that I used the laser cutter to cut the peices out of wood.

After I cut the pieces out I handsaw multiple tubes and wooden rods in order to make the conveyor belt and the axels of the tubes and wheels.

I then started to assemble the conveyor belt using the rubber glue, wood glue, screws, and the handheld drill.

## Making it move:
In order to make it move I need to make a base on the side of the conveyor belt to keep the circuit in place. 
Here is the hardware design:

I programmed the motor to turn on and off at the flip of a switch. I also had to connect it to a battery.
Here is how it looks like:

Here is the code:

### Wheels
## Things you need:

I made 4 wheels measuring 76.20 mm in diameter with a small hole of 9.80 mm in diameter in its center in fusion360 and then used the laser cutter to cut them out. 
<center><img src="" width="500" ></center>

I used the wooden rod as the axel of my wheels and used wood glue to glue them together. Now that that's dried I can move on to working on the base of the machine and motors.

This is the sketch of how we will connect the axels to the motor on the bottom of the base.
