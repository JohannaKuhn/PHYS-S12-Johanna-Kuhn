## 8: CNC Milling, Molding & Casting
______________________________________________________________________________________
For this assignment I decided to make a small pendant. I wanted to make something useful for my final project, but couldn't come up with any parts that would be best made and recreated with a mold.

### Design:
I created a 3D STL of a pendant.
First I made the border of the mold by making two rectangles in a sketch on Fusion360. I saved sketch and then revolved the shape 360 degrees. Now the border is completed.

After I made the pendant shape by connecting two circles by lines and then making a smaller circle on the upper top of the shape. Once that was completed I free drew a design for the pendant.

### Make the mold:
When I was happy with the design I moved the file to the CNC machine. I
